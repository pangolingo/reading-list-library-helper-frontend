  <description>At the dawn of the nineteenth century, two very different magicians emerge to change England's history. In the year 1806, with the Napoleonic Wars raging on land and sea, most people believe magic to be long dead in England--until the reclusive Mr Norrell reveals his powers, and becomes a celebrity overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, another practicing magician comes forth: the young, handsome, and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's student, and they join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic, straining his partnership with Norrell, and putting at risk everything else he holds dear.</description>

  <description>Johannes Cabal and his rather inexact powers of necromancy are back once more. This time, his talents are purchased by The Fear Institute as they hunt for the Phobic Animus - the embodiment of fear. The three Institute members, led by Cabal and his Silver Key, enter the Dreamlands and find themselves pursued by walking trees plagued with giant ticks, stone men that patrol the ruins of their castles, cats that feed on human flesh and phobias which torment and devastate. The intrepid explorers are killed off one by one as they traipse through this obfuscating and frustrating world, where history itself appears to alter. Cabal, annoyed that the quest is becoming increasingly heroic, finds himself alone with the Institute's only remaining survivor, and after a shockingly violent experiment, begins to suspect that not everything is quite as it seems...</description>

  <description>Johannes Cabal has never pretended to be a hero of any kind. There is, after all, little heroic about robbing graves, stealing occult volumes, and being on middling terms with demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His purpose, however, is noble. His researches are all directed to raising the dead. Not as monstrosities but as people, just as they were when they lived: physically, mentally, and spiritually. For such a prize, some sacrifices are necessary. One such sacrifice was his own soul, but he now sees that was a mistake - it's not just that he needs it for his research to have validity, but now he realises he needs it to be himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, his soul now rests within the festering bureaucracy of Hell. Satan may be cruel and capricious but, most dangerously, he is bored. It is Cabal's unhappy lot to provide him with amusement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, a wager: in return for his own soul, Cabal must gather one hundred others. Placed in control of a diabolical carnival - created to tempt to contentiousness, to blasphemy, argumentation and murder, but one that may also win coconuts - and armed only with his intelligence, a very large handgun, and a total absence of whimsy, Cabal has one year.</description>

  <description>"Possibly his best travel book...an observant and frequently hilarious account of a trip that took him to 51 Pacific Islands."&lt;br /&gt;TIME&lt;br /&gt;Renowned travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux has been many places in his life and tried almost everything. But this trip in and around the lands of the Pacific may be his boldest, most fascinating yet. From New Zealand's rain forests, to crocodile-infested New Guinea, over isolated atolls, through dirty harbors, daring weather and coastlines, he travels by Kayak wherever the winds take him--and what he discovers is the world to explore and try to understand.</description>

  <description>Award-winning travel writer Paul Theroux invites you aboard&lt;i&gt; The Old Patagonian Express by Train through the Americas&lt;/i&gt;; packed with powerful descriptions and portraits of the many colours of humanity, &lt;i&gt;The Old Patagonian Express&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A witty sharply observed journey down the length of North and South America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning his journey in Boston, where he boarded the subway commuter train, and catching trains of all kinds on the way, Paul Theroux tells of his voyage from ice-bound Massachusetts and Illinois to the arid plateau of Argentina's most southerly tip. Sweating and shivering by turns as the temperature and altitude shoot up and down, thrown in with the appalling Mr Thornberry in Limón and reading nightly to the blind writer, Borges, in Buenos Aires, Theroux vividly evokes the contrasts of a journey 'to the end of the line'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American travel writer Paul Theroux is known for the rich descriptions of people and places that is often streaked with his distinctive sense of irony; his other non-fiction titles, &lt;i&gt;Riding the Iron Rooster&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Happy Isles of Oceania&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sunrise with Seamonsters&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Kingdom by the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Tao of Travel&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ghost Train to the Eastern Star&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Great Railway Bazaar&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dark Star Safari&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fresh-air Fiend&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sir Vidia's Shadow&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Pillars of Hercules&lt;/i&gt;, and his novels and collections of short stories, including the James Tait Black Memorial Prize winner &lt;i&gt;The Mosquito Coast&lt;/i&gt; are available from Penguin.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Dark Star Safari&lt;/i&gt; the wittily observant and endearingly irascible Paul Theroux takes readers the length of Africa by rattletrap bus, dugout canoe, cattle truck, armed convoy, ferry, and train. In the course of his epic and enlightening journey, he endures danger, delay, and dismaying circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gauging the state of affairs, he talks to Africans, aid workers, missionaries, and tourists. What results is an insightful mediation on the history, politics, and beauty of Africa and its people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a new postscript, Theroux recounts the dramatic events of a return to Africa to visit Zimbabwe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The iconic visionary returns with his first new novel since the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Spook Country&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whatever you do, because you are an artist, will bring you to the next thing of your own...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When she sang for The Curfew, Hollis Henry's face was known worldwide. She still runs into people who remember the poster. Unfortunately, in the post-crash economy, cult memorabilia doesn't pay the rent, and right now she's a journalist in need of a job. The last person she wants to work for is Hubertus Bigend, twisted genius of global marketing; but there's no way to tell an entity like Bigend that you want nothing more to do with him. That simply brings you more firmly to his attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Milgrim is clean, drug-free for the first time in a decade. It took eight months in a clinic in Basel. Fifteen complete changes of his blood. Bigend paid for all that. Milgrim's idiomatic Russian is superb, and he notices things. Meanwhile no one notices Milgrim. That makes him worth every penny, though it cost Bigend more than his cartel-grade custom-armored truck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The culture of the military has trickled down to the street- Bigend knows that, and he'll find a way to take a cut. What surprises him though is that someone else seems to be on top of that situation in a way that Bigend associates only with himself. Bigend loves staring into the abyss of the global market; he's just not used to it staring back.</description>

  <description>Although Colin Laney (from Gibson's earlier novel &lt;i&gt;Idoru&lt;/i&gt;) lives in a cardboard box, he has the power to change the world. Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see "nodal points" in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin sends Barry Rydell (last seen in Gibson's novel &lt;i&gt;Virtual Light&lt;/i&gt;) to the bridge to find a mysterious killer who reveals himself only by his lack of presence on the Net. Barry is also entrusted with a strange package that seems to be the home of Rei Toi, the computer-generated "idol singer" who once tried to "marry" a human rock star (she's also from &lt;i&gt;Idoru&lt;/i&gt;). Barry and Rei Toi are eventually joined by Barry's old girlfriend Chevette (from &lt;i&gt;Virtual Light&lt;/i&gt;) and a young boy named Silencio who has an unnatural fascination with watches. Together this motley assortment of characters holds the key to stopping billionaire Cody Harwood from doing whatever it is that will make sure he still holds the reigns of power after the nodal point takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;All Tomorrow's Parties&lt;/i&gt; includes characters from two of Gibson's earlier novels, it's not a direct sequel to either. It's a stand-alone book.&lt;i&gt;--Craig E. Engler&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>William Gibson, author of the extraordinary multiaward-winning novel &lt;i&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/i&gt;, has written his most brilliant and thrilling work to date... &lt;i&gt;The Mona Lisa Overdrive&lt;/i&gt;. Enter Gibson's unique world - lyric and mechanical, erotic and violent, sobering and exciting - where multinational corporations and high tech outlaws vie for power, traveling into the computer-generated universe known as cyberspace. Into this world comes Mona, a young girl with a murky past and an uncertain future whose life is on a collision course with internationally famous Sense/Net star Angie Mitchell. Since childhood, Angie has been able to tap into cyberspace &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a computer. Now, from inside cyberspace, a kidnapping plot is masterminded by a phantom entity who has plans for Mona, Angie, and all humanity, plans that cannot be controlled... or even known. And behind the intrigue lurks the shadowy Yakuza, the powerful Japanese underworld, whose leaders ruthlessly manipulate people and events to suit their own purposes... or so they think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A corporate mercenary wakes in a reconstructed body, a beautiful woman by his side. Then Hosaka Corporation reactivates him, for a mission more dangerous than the one he’s recovering from: to get a defecting chief of R&amp;amp;D—and the biochip he’s perfected—out intact. But this proves to be of supreme interest to certain other parties—some of whom aren’t remotely human...</description>

  <description>Cayce Pollard is an expensive, spookily intuitive market-research consultant. In London on a job, she is offered a secret assignment: to investigate some intriguing snippets of video that have been appearing on the Internet. An entire subculture of people is obsessed with these bits of footage, and anybody who can create that kind of brand loyalty would be a gold mine for Cayce's client. But when her borrowed apartment is burgled and her computer hacked, she realizes there's more to this project than she had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Cayce is her father's daughter, and the danger makes her stubborn. Win Pollard, ex-security expert, probably ex-CIA, took a taxi in the direction of the World Trade Center on September 11 one year ago, and is presumed dead. Win taught Cayce a bit about the way agents work. She is still numb at his loss, and, as much for him as for any other reason, she refuses to give up this newly weird job, which will take her to Tokyo and on to Russia. With help and betrayal from equally unlikely quarters, Cayce will follow the trail of the mysterious film to its source, and in the process will learn something about her father's life and death.</description>

  <description>The title represents the battle cry and motto of the famous Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Regiment as they parachuted into Normandy in World War II. This story, told by a man who was there, was first published in 1967 and appears in mass market for the first time. Dwight D. Eisenhower called this book "a fascinating tale of personal combat".</description>

  <description>After the Allied defeat in the Battle of the Bulge, the Screaming Eagles were rushed to Bastogne, a small Belgian crossroads town where seven roads met. The lightly armed paratrooper unit became the "cork in the bottle" of the Nazi onslaught; Bastogne became the key to victory. The soldiers immediately found themselves in close combat. Without enough ammunition, food, or clothing, in freezing weather and deep snow, they held out against the best the Nazis could throw at them, buying the time needed for Patton's Third Army to arrive from the South.</description>

  <description>Ever since Newton witnessed a bubble rising from his bathtub, mankind has sought the stars. When William III of England commissioned Capt. William Kidd to command the first expedition to Mars in the late 1600s, they proved that space travel was both possible and profitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, one century later, a plantation in the flourishing British colony on Mars is home to Arabella Ashby. A tomboy who shares her father’s deft hand with complex automatons. Being raised on the Martian frontier by her Martian nanny, Arabella is more a wild child than a proper young lady. Something her mother plans to remedy with a move to an exotic world Arabella has never seen: London, England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arabella soon finds herself trying to navigate an alien world until a dramatic change in her family’s circumstances forces her to defy all conventions in order to return to Mars in order to save both her brother and the plantation. To do this, Arabella must pass as a boy on the Diana, a ship serving the Mars Trading Company with a mysterious Indian captain who is intrigued by her knack with automatons. Arabella must weather the naval war between Britain and France, learning how to sail, and a mutinous crew if she hopes to save her brother from certain death.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Forms that Work: Designing Web Forms for Usability&lt;/i&gt; clearly explains exactly how to design great forms for the web. The book provides proven and practical advice that will help you avoid pitfalls, and produce forms that are aesthetically pleasing, efficient and cost-effective. It features invaluable design methods, tips, and tricks to help ensure accurate data and satisfied customers. It includes dozens of examples - from nitty-gritty details (label alignment, mandatory fields) to visual designs (creating good grids, use of color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book isn't just about colons and choosing the right widgets. It's about the whole process of making good forms, which has a lot more to do with making sure you're asking the right questions in a way that your users can answer than it does with whether you use a drop-down list or radio buttons. In an easy-to-read format with lots of examples, the authors present their three-layer model - relationship, conversation, appearance. You need all three for a successful form - a form that looks good, flows well, asks the right questions in the right way, and, most important of all, gets people to fill it out. Liberally illustrated with full-color examples, this book guides readers on how to define requirements, how to write questions that users will understand and want to answer, and how to deal with instructions, progress indicators and errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is essential reading for HCI professionals, web designers, software developers, user interface designers, HCI academics and students, market research professionals, and financial professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Provides proven and practical advice that will help you avoid pitfalls, and produce forms that are aesthetically pleasing, efficient and cost-effective. &lt;br /&gt;*Features invaluable design methods, tips, and tricks to help ensure accurate data and satisfied customers. &lt;br /&gt;*Includes dozens of examples -- from nitty-gritty details (label alignment, mandatory fields) to visual designs (creating good grids, use of color). &lt;br /&gt;*Foreword by Steve Krug, author of the best selling &lt;i&gt;Don't Make Me Think!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In an unnamed Middle Eastern security state, a young Arab-Indian hacker shields his clients—dissidents, outlaws, Islamists, and other watched groups—from surveillance and tries to stay out of trouble. He goes by Alif—the first letter of the Arabic alphabet, and a convenient handle to hide behind. The aristocratic woman Alif loves has jilted him for a prince chosen by her parents, and his computer has just been breached by the state’s electronic security force, putting his clients and his own neck on the line. Then it turns out his lover’s new fiancé is the "Hand of God," as they call the head of state security, and his henchmen come after Alif, driving him underground. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alif discovers &lt;i&gt;The Thousand and One Days&lt;/i&gt;, the secret book of the jinn, which both he and the Hand suspect may unleash a new level of information technology, the stakes are raised and Alif must struggle for life or death, aided by forces seen and unseen.</description>

  <description>Often referred to as the "black art" because of its complexity and uncertainty, software estimation is not as difficult or puzzling as people think. In fact, generating accurate estimates is straightforward--once you understand the art of creating them. In his highly anticipated book, acclaimed author Steve McConnell unravels the mystery to successful software estimation--distilling academic information and real-world experience into a practical guide for working software professionals. Instead of arcane treatises and rigid modeling techniques, this guide highlights a proven set of procedures, understandable formulas, and heuristics that individuals and development teams can apply to their projects to help achieve estimation proficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover how to: Estimate schedule and cost--or estimate the functionality that can be delivered within a given time frame Avoid common software estimation mistakes Learn estimation techniques for you, your team, and your organization * Estimate specific project activities--including development, management, and defect correction Apply estimation approaches to any type of project--small or large, agile or traditional Navigate the shark-infested political waters that surround project estimates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When many corporate software projects are failing, McConnell shows you what works for successful software estimation.</description>

  <description>Water spirits, moon maidens, haunted pianos, headless revenants, and an invincible terrapin that lives under the mountains. None of these distract James Holtzclaw from his employer's mission: to turn the fading gold-rush town of Auraria, GA, into a first-class resort and drown its fortunes below a man-made lake. But when Auraria's peculiar people and problematic ghosts collide with his own rival ambitions, Holtzclaw must decide what he will save and what will be washed away. Taking its inspiration from a real Georgia ghost town, Auraria is steeped in the folklore of the Southern Appalachians, where the tensions of natural, supernatural and artificial are still alive.</description>

  <description>De los autores de Reinicia • Un libro igualmente revolucionario y lleno de sentido común • Una nueva forma de trabajar El paradigma de la Revolución industrial que debía realizar todo el trabajo bajo un mismo techo está declinando rápidamente debido a las nuevas tecnologías que permiten a los trabajadores colaborar entre sí sin estar físicamente en contacto. El nuevo paradigma es “llevar el trabajo a los trabajadores y no los trabajadores al trabajo”. Las empresas que adoptan este sistema tienen múltiples ventajas, especialmente en lo que hace a satisfacción de los trabajadores que tienen flexibilidad para hacer su trabajo cuando más les conviene con sus necesidades personales Además el trabajo en remoto, hace que las empresas puedan ahorrar grandes cantidades de dinero en infraestructura. Los autores no hablan teóricamente, sino basados en sus propias experiencias y en las de decenas de casos que se cuentan en el libro.</description>

  <description>Since Don’t Make Me Think was first published in 2000, over 400,000 Web designers and developers have relied on Steve Krug’s guide to help them understand the principles of intuitive navigation and information design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this 3rd edition, Steve returns with fresh perspective to reexamine the principles that made Don’t Make Me Think a classic-–with updated examples and a new chapter on mobile usability. And it’s still short, profusely illustrated…and best of all–fun to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve read it before, you’ll rediscover what made Don’t Make Me Think so essential to Web designers and developers around the world. If you’ve never read it, you’ll see why so many people have said it should be required reading for anyone working on Web sites.</description>

  <description>Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fictional writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, &lt;i&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fifty years after its original publication, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Catch-22 &lt;/i&gt;remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—novels of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by &lt;i&gt;Time, Newsweek, &lt;/i&gt;the Modern Library, and the London &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. Since its publication in 1961, no novel has matched &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt;’s intensity and brilliance in depicting the brutal insanity of war. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical responses and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and a selection of advertisements from the original publishing campaign that helped turn &lt;i&gt;Catch-22 &lt;/i&gt;into a cultural phenomenon. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.</description>

  <description>As a satire, Flatland offers pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as "the best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions." As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics, and computer science students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a two-dimensional world referred to as Flatland. All existence is limited to length and breadth in Flatland, its inhabitants unable even to imagine a third dimension. The amiable narrator, A Square, provides an overview of this fantastic world—its physics and metaphysics, its history, customs, and religious beliefs. But when a strange visitor mysteriously appears and transports the incredulous Flatlander to Spaceland, a land of three dimensions, his worldview is forever shattered.</description>

  <description>First published more than thirty years ago, Paul Theroux's strange, unique, and hugely entertaining railway odyssey has become a modern classic of travel literature. Here Theroux recounts his early adventures on an unusual grand continental tour. Asia's fabled trains -- the Orient Express, the Khyber Pass Local, the Frontier Mail, the Golden Arrow to Kuala Lumpur, the Mandalay Express, the Trans-Siberian Express -- are the stars of a journey that takes him on a loop eastbound from London's Victoria Station to Tokyo Central, then back from Japan on the Trans-Siberian. Brimming with Theroux's signature humor and wry observations, this engrossing chronicle is essential reading for both the ardent adventurer and the armchair traveler.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover for this isbn can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3480930-the-catcher-in-the-rye" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his debut in 1951 as &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE GREAT GATSBY&lt;/b&gt;, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted “gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,” it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now more than ever: Aldous Huxley's enduring "masterpiece ... one of the most prophetic dystopian works of the 20th century" (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) must be read and understood by anyone concerned with preserving the human spirit in the face of our "brave new world"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt; is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order--all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. &lt;em&gt;Brave New World, &lt;/em&gt;his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt; likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English." —C&lt;em&gt;hicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>John Crowley's masterful &lt;i&gt;Little, Big&lt;/i&gt; is the epic story of Smoky Barnable, an anonymous young man who travels by foot from the City to a place called Edgewood—not found on any map—to marry Daily Alice Drinkwater, as was prophesied. It is the story of four generations of a singular family, living in a house that is many houses on the magical border of an otherworld. It is a story of fantastic love and heartrending loss; of impossible things and unshakable destinies; and of the great Tale that envelops us all. It is a wonder.</description>

  <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that: &lt;br /&gt;(1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces &lt;br /&gt;(2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations &lt;br /&gt;(3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt; really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.</description>

  <description>In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person’s consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or “sleeve”) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats “existence” as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning. . . .</description>

  <description>The computer revolution brought with it new methods of getting work done—just look at today's news for reports of hard-driven, highly-motivated young software and online commerce developers who sacrifice evenings and weekends to meet impossible deadlines. Tracy Kidder got a preview of this world in the late 1970s when he observed the engineers of Data General design and build a new 32-bit minicomputer in just one year. His thoughtful, prescient book, &lt;i&gt;The Soul of a New Machine&lt;/i&gt;, tells stories of 35-year-old "veteran" engineers hiring recent college graduates and encouraging them to work harder and faster on complex and difficult projects, exploiting the youngsters' ignorance of normal scheduling processes while engendering a new kind of work ethic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, we are used to the "total commitment" philosophy of managing technical creation, but Kidder was surprised and even a little alarmed at the obsessions and compulsions he found. From in-house political struggles to workers being permitted to tease management to marathon 24-hour work sessions, &lt;i&gt;The Soul of a New Machine&lt;/i&gt; explores concepts that already seem familiar, even old-hat, less than 20 years later. Kidder plainly admires his subjects; while he admits to hopeless confusion about their work, he finds their dedication heroic. The reader wonders, though, what will become of it all, now and in the future. &lt;i&gt;—Rob Lightner&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Poor Duncan just wants to color. But when he opens his box of crayons, he finds only letters, all saying the same thing: We quit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beige is tired of playing second fiddle to Brown. Blue needs a break from coloring all that water, while Pink just wants to be used. Green has no complaints, but Orange and Yellow are no longer speaking to each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Duncan to do? Debut author Drew Daywalt and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Oliver Jeffers create a colorful solution in this playful, imaginative story that will have children laughing and playing with their crayons in a whole new way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harry Dresden--Wizard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business has been slow. Okay, business has been dead. And not even of the undead variety. You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book. But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work--magical &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; mundane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brutally mutilated corpse. Strange-looking paw prints. A full moon. Take three guesses--and the first two don't count...</description>

Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Dresden has faced some pretty terrifying foes during his career. Giant scorpions. Oversexed vampires. Psychotic werewolves. It comes with the territory when you're the only professional wizard in the Chicago-area phone book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all Harry's years of supernatural sleuthing, he's never faced anything like this: The spirit world has gone postal. All over Chicago, ghosts are causing trouble - and not just of the door-slamming, boo-shouting variety. These ghosts are tormented, violent, and deadly. Someone - or &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; - is purposely stirring them up to wreak unearthly havoc. But why? And why do so many of the victims have ties to Harry? If Harry doesn't figure it out soon, he could wind up a ghost himself....</description>

  <description>Quentin Coldwater has been cast out of Fillory, the secret magical land of his childhood dreams. With nothing left to lose, he returns to where his story began, the Brakebills Preparatory College of Magic, but he can’t hide from his past, and it’s not long before it comes looking for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with Plum, a brilliant young undergraduate with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters. But all roads lead back to Fillory, and his new life takes him to old haunts, like Antarctica, and to buried secrets and old friends he thought were lost forever. He uncovers the key to a sorcery masterwork, a spell that could create magical utopia, and a new Fillory--but casting it will set in motion a chain of events that will bring Earth and Fillory crashing together. To save them he will have to risk sacrificing everything.</description>

  <description>For fans of The Chronicles of Narnia comes the first book in the Wildwood Chronicles, the New York Times bestselling fantasy adventure series by Colin Meloy, lead singer of the Decemberists, and Carson Ellis, acclaimed illustrator of The Mysterious Benedict Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Wildwood, Prue and her friend Curtis uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval—a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much greater as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness. A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wildwood captivates readers with the wonder and thrill of a secret world within the landscape of a modern city. It feels at once firmly steeped in the classics of children's literature and completely fresh at the same time. The story is told from multiple points of view, and the book features more than eighty illustrations, including six full-color plates, making this an absolutely gorgeous object.</description>

  <description>Why has the durable paper shopping bag been largely replaced by its flimsy plastic counterpart? What circuitous chain of improvements led to such innovations as the automobile cup holder and the swiveling vegetable peeler? With the same relentless curiosity and lucid, witty prose he brought to his earlier books, Henry Petroski looks at some of our most familiar objects and reveals that they are, in fact, works in progress. For there can never be an end to the quest for the perfect design. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To illustrate his thesis, Petroski tells the story of the paper drinking cup, which owes its popularity to the discovery that water glasses could carry germs. He pays tribute to the little plastic tripod that keeps pizza from sticking to the box and analyzes the numerical layouts of telephones and handheld calculators. &lt;b&gt;Small Things Considered&lt;/b&gt; is Petroski at his most trenchant and provocative, casting his eye not only on everyday artifacts but on their users as well.</description>

  <description>Sherman Alexie tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Determined to take his future into his own hands, Junior leaves his troubled school on the rez to attend an all-white farm town high school where the only other Indian is the school mascot. Heartbreaking, funny, and beautifully written, &lt;em&gt;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on the author's own experiences, coupled with poignant drawings that reflect the character's art, chronicles the contemporary adolescence of one Native American boy as he attempts to break away from the life he thought he was destined to live.</description>

  <description>Water spirits, moon maidens, haunted pianos, headless revenants, and an invincible terrapin that lives under the mountains. None of these distract James Holtzclaw from his employer's mission: to turn the fading gold-rush town of Auraria, GA, into a first-class resort and drown its fortunes below a man-made lake. But when Auraria's peculiar people and problematic ghosts collide with his own rival ambitions, Holtzclaw must decide what he will save and what will be washed away. Taking its inspiration from a real Georgia ghost town, Auraria is steeped in the folklore of the Southern Appalachians, where the tensions of natural, supernatural and artificial are still alive.</description>

  <description>Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? Award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi delivers one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction novels of the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;If they were a hall of fame or shame for computer hackers, a Kevin Mitnick plaque would be mounted the near the entrance. While other nerds were fumbling with password possibilities, this adept break-artist was penetrating the digital secrets of Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment Corporation, Nokia, Motorola, Pacific Bell, and other mammoth enterprises. His Ghost in the Wires memoir paints an action portrait of a plucky loner motivated by a passion for trickery, not material game. (P.S. Mitnick's capers have already been the subject of two books and a movie. This first-person account is the most comprehensive to date.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Children can have a cruel, absolute sense of justice. Children can kill a monster and feel quite proud of themselves. A girl can look at her brother and believe they’re destined to be a knight and a bard who battle evil. She can believe she’s found the thing she’s been made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hazel lives with her brother, Ben, in the strange town of Fairfold where humans and fae exist side by side. The faeries’ seemingly harmless magic attracts tourists, but Hazel knows how dangerous they can be, and she knows how to stop them. Or she did, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of it all, there is a glass coffin in the woods. It rests right on the ground and in it sleeps a boy with horns on his head and ears as pointed as knives. Hazel and Ben were both in love with him as children. The boy has slept there for generations, never waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, he does…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the world turns upside down, Hazel tries to remember her years pretending to be a knight. But swept up in new love, shifting loyalties, and the fresh sting of betrayal, will it be enough?</description>

  <description>May 1945. Hitler is dead, and the Third Reich little more than smoking rubble. No GI wants to be the last man killed in action against the Germans. But for cigar-chewing, rough-talking, hard-drinking, hard-charging Captain Jack Lee and his men, there is one more mission: rescue fourteen prominent French prisoners held in an SS-guarded castle high in the Austrian Alps. It’s a dangerous mission, but Lee has help from a decorated German Wehrmacht officer and his men, who voluntarily join the fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on personal memoirs, author interviews, and official American, German, and French histories, The Last Battle is the nearly unbelievable story of the most improbable battle of World War II — a tale of unlikely allies, bravery, cowardice, and desperate combat between implacable enemies.</description>

  <description>It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune — and remarkable power — to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved — that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt — among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life — and love — in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A world at stake. &lt;br /&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize. &lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Series Info:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first part of the "Forever War" series, however it can be read as a standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand—despite the fact that the fierce alien enemy that they would oppose is inscrutable, unconquerable, and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite Military unit, Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and time to fight in the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties and do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal and return home. But "home" may be even more terrifying than battle, because, thanks to the time dilation caused by space travel, Mandella is aging months while the Earth he left behind is aging centuries.</description>

  <description>Five years and more than 100,000 copies after it was first published, it's hard to imagine anyone working in Web design who hasn't read Steve Krug's "instant classic" on Web usability, but people are still discovering it every day. In this second edition, Steve adds three new chapters in the same style as the original: wry and entertaining, yet loaded with insights and practical advice for novice and veteran alike. Don't be surprised if it completely changes the way you think about Web design. &lt;br /&gt; Three New Chapters!&lt;br /&gt; Usability as common courtesy -- Why people really leave Web sites Web Accessibility, CSS, and you -- Making sites usable and accessible Help! My boss wants me to ______. -- Surviving executive design whims &lt;br /&gt; "I thought usability was the enemy of design until I read the first edition of this book. "Don't Make Me Think! "showed me how to put myself in the position of the person who uses my site. After reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book. &lt;br /&gt; In this second edition, Steve Krug adds essential ammunition for those whose bosses, clients, stakeholders, and marketing managers insist on doing the wrong thing. If you design, write, program, own, or manage Web sites, you must read this book." -- Jeffrey Zeldman, author of "Designing with Web Standards" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>Key West—southernmost point in the United States, Mile Zero on Highway 1; and as far as you can run away from your past troubles without swimming to Cuba. Key West—originally Cayo Huesos or Isle of Bones, for centuries a refuge for pirates, wreckers, writers, scoundrels, drunks, and tourists. Now home to a Crew of techno geek con artists who've turned it into their own private hunting ground. Paul and Chloe have the run of the sun-drenched island, free to play and scam far from the enemies they left behind in Silicon Valley. But that doesn't mean they can't bring a little high tech know how to the paradise. They and their new Crew have covered the island with their own private Big Brother style network—hidden cameras, RFID sensors, and a web of informers that tip them off about every crime committed and tourist trapped on the island. But will all the gadgets and games be enough when not one but three rival crews of con artists come to hold a top-secret gang summit? And when one of them is murdered, who will solve the crime? Inspired by author Rick Dakan's own eventful experiences in the video game and comic book industries, the Geek Mafia series satisfies the hunger in all of us to buck the system, take revenge on corporate America, and live a life of excitement and adventure.</description>

  <description>Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? Award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi delivers one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction novels of the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>Peter Seibel interviews 16 of the most interesting computer programmers alive today in Coders at Work, offering a brand-new companion volume to Apress’s highly acclaimed best-seller Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston. As the words "at work" suggest, Peter Seibel focuses on how his interviewees tackle the day–to–day work of programming, while revealing much more, like how they became great programmers, how they recognize programming talent in others, and what kinds of problems they find most interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of people have suggested names of programmers to interview on the Coders at Work web site: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.codersatwork.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.codersatwork.com&lt;/a&gt;. The complete list was 284 names. Having digested everyone’s feedback, we selected 16 folks who’ve been kind enough to agree to be interviewed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Frances Allen: Pioneer in optimizing compilers, first woman to win the Turing Award (2006) and first female IBM fellow&lt;br /&gt;- Joe Armstrong: Inventor of Erlang&lt;br /&gt;- Joshua Bloch: Author of the Java collections framework, now at Google&lt;br /&gt;- Bernie Cosell: One of the main software guys behind the original ARPANET IMPs and a master debugger&lt;br /&gt;- Douglas Crockford: JSON founder, JavaScript architect at Yahoo!&lt;br /&gt;- L. Peter Deutsch: Author of Ghostscript, implementer of Smalltalk-80 at Xerox PARC and Lisp 1.5 on PDP-1&lt;br /&gt;- Brendan Eich: Inventor of JavaScript, CTO of the Mozilla Corporation &lt;br /&gt;- Brad Fitzpatrick: Writer of LiveJournal, OpenID, memcached, and Perlbal &lt;br /&gt;- Dan Ingalls: Smalltalk implementor and designer&lt;br /&gt;- Simon Peyton Jones: Coinventor of Haskell and lead designer of Glasgow Haskell Compiler&lt;br /&gt;- Donald Knuth: Author of The Art of Computer Programming and creator of TeX&lt;br /&gt;- Peter Norvig: Director of Research at Google and author of the standard text on AI&lt;br /&gt;- Guy Steele: Coinventor of Scheme and part of the Common Lisp Gang of Five, currently working on Fortress&lt;br /&gt;- Ken Thompson: Inventor of UNIX&lt;br /&gt;- Jamie Zawinski: Author of XEmacs and early Netscape/Mozilla hacker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you’ll learn:&lt;br /&gt;How the best programmers in the world do their job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this book for?&lt;br /&gt;Programmers interested in the point of view of leaders in the field. Programmers looking for approaches that work for some of these outstanding programmers.</description>

  <description>In the early days of the Civil War, rumors of gold in the frozen Klondike brought hordes of newcomers to the Pacific Northwest. Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska’s ice. Thus was Dr. Blue’s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives Blue’s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to Fillory in the riveting sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller and literary phenomenon, &lt;i&gt;The Magicians&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin Coldwater should be happy. He escaped a miserable Brooklyn childhood, matriculated at a secret college for magic, and graduated to discover that Fillory—a fictional utopia—was actually real. But even as a Fillorian king, Quentin finds little peace. His old restlessness returns, and he longs for the thrills a heroic quest can bring.&lt;br /&gt;Accompanied by his oldest friend, Julia, Quentin sets off—only to somehow wind up back in the real world and not in Fillory, as they'd hoped. As the pair struggle to find their way back to their lost kingdom, Quentin is forced to rely on Julia's illicitly-learned sorcery as they face a sinister threat in a world very far from the beloved fantasy novels of their youth.</description>

  <description>"The machine had been invented a few years ago: a machine that could tell, from just a sample of your blood, how you were going to die. It didn't give you the date and it didn't give you specifics. It just spat out a sliver of paper upon which were printed, in careful block letters, the words DROWNED or CANCER or OLD AGE or CHOKED ON A HANDFUL OF POPCORN. It let people know how they were going to die." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Machine of Death&lt;/i&gt; tells thirty-four different stories about people who know how they will die. Prepare to have your tears jerked, your spine tingled, your funny bone tickled, your mind blown, your pulse quickened, or your heart warmed. Or better yet, simply prepare to be surprised. Because even when people do have perfect knowledge of the future, there's no telling exactly how things will turn out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring stories by: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Randall Munroe&lt;br /&gt;* Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw&lt;br /&gt;* Tom Francis&lt;br /&gt;* Camille Alexa&lt;br /&gt;* Erin McKean&lt;br /&gt;* James L. Sutter&lt;br /&gt;* Douglas J.

  <description>IT TAKES A GRAVEYARD TO RAISE A CHILD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy - an ancient indigo man, a gateway to abandoned city of ghouls, the strange and terrible fleer. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will be in danger from the man Jack - who has already killed Bod's family . . .</description>

  <description>Complete in nine handsome volumes, each with an introduction by a Doyle scholar, a chronology, a selected bibliography, and explanatory notes, the Oxford Sherlock Holmes series offers a definitive collection of the famous detective's adventures. No home library is complete without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comprising the series of short stories that made the fortunes of the Strand, the magazine in which they were first published, this volume won even more popularity for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Holmes is at the height of his powers in many of his most famous cases, including &lt;i&gt;The Red-Headed League&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Speckled Band&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Blue Carbuncle&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S. Morgenstern classic, The Princess Bride. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the "good parts" reached his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Goldman does Dad one better. He's reconstructed the "Good Parts Version" to delight wise kids and wide-eyed grownups everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True Love. Strong Hate. Harsh Revenge. A Few Giants. Lots of Bad Men. Lots of Good Men. Five or Six Beautiful Women. Beasties Monstrous and Gentle. Some Swell Escapes and Captures. Death, Lies, Truth, Miracles, and a Little Sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it's about everything.</description>

  <description>This beloved book by E. B. White, author of Stuart Little and The Trumpet of the Swan, is a classic of children's literature that is "just about perfect."&lt;br /&gt;Some Pig. Humble. Radiant. These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high up in Zuckerman's barn. Charlotte's spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, who simply wants a friend. They also express the love of a girl named Fern, who saved Wilbur's life when he was born the runt of his litter.&lt;br /&gt;E. B. White's Newbery Honor Book is a tender novel of friendship, love, life, and death that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come. This edition contains color illustrations by Garth Williams, the acclaimed illustrator of E.B. White's Stuart Little and Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series, among many other books.&lt;br /&gt;Supports the Common Core State Standards</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>It’s 1868 and Sir Harry Flashman, V.C., arch-cad, amorist, cold-headed soldier, and reluctant hero, is back! Fleeing a chain of vengeful pursuers that includes Mexican bandits, the French Foreign Legion, and the relatives of an infatuated Austrian beauty, Flashy is desperate for somewhere to take cover. So desperate, in fact, that he embarks on a perilous secret intelligence-gathering mission to help free a group of Britons being held captive by a tyrannical Abyssinian king. Along the way, of course, are nightmare castles, brigands, massacres, rebellions, orgies, and the loveliest and most lethal women in Africa, all of which will test the limits of the great bounder’s talents for knavery, amorous intrigue, and survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flashman on the March—&lt;/i&gt;the twelfth book in George MacDonald Fraser’s ever-beloved, always scandalous Flashman Papers series--is Flashman and Fraser at their best.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>Sloth's phone rings and rings. He races across the room to answer the call, but he's a sloth, so it takes a while. The phone says he's won an afternoon shopping spree! Can the sloth get to the store in time to claim his prize? Yes, but it's going to take an impromptu zipline, a missed bus, a parkful of trees, an oblivious ice-cream vendor, a rainbow hang glider, and an out-of-control shopping cart to make it happen. As soon as the spree begins, the sloth crashes into a pillow display and falls asleep, exhausted from excitement. When he awakes, he finds himself the proud and happy owner of&lt;br /&gt;several fine new pillows. Mission accomplished.</description>

  <description>ISTANBUL: QUEEN OF CITIES. Here histories, empires, and continents meet and cross. It is the mid-twenty first century and Turkey is a proud and powerful member of a European Union that runs from the Atlantic to Mt. Ararat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sleepy Istanbul district of Eskiköy stands the former whirling dervish house of Adem Dede. Six characters' lives revolve around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A retired economist&lt;/b&gt; from the Greek community is hired into a top-security think tank, but keeps a dark secret from another century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A nine-year-old boy, &lt;/b&gt;confined to a silent world by a heart condition where any sudden sound could kill him, becomes a reluctant detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rogues trader&lt;/b&gt; sets up the deal o the century smuggling contraband gas but discovers it's only the tip of an iceberg of corporate fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An art dealer&lt;/b&gt; takes an offer she can't refuse--a genuine legend of old Istanbul--and finds herself swept up in ancient intrigues and rivalries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A slacker&lt;/b&gt; finds his life forever changed after an act of urban terrorism gives him the ability to see djinn--and they're just the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young marketing graduate&lt;/b&gt; has five days to save a family nanotechnology start-up with a new product that may just change the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the space of five days of an Istanbul heat wave, these lives weave a story of corporate wheeling and dealing, Islamic mysticism, political and economic intrigues, ancient Ottoman mysteries, a terrifying new terrorist threat, and a nanotechnology with the potential to transform every human on the planet.</description>
